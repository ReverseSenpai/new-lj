#Monday the 10th  
Today sucked. Catching up from Friday is taking its toll. It also felt today that the TA's were extremely busy and everyone was struggling. I knew what I had to do but I couldn't get it to work on code. And past that I have no idea if I can do this class anymore. For loops still mess me up and they are a huge part of what we're doing right now. I don't know if its this assignment or just coding in general saying that I don't get it. I don't know if I'm in the pit or not meant to be here. DOM seems confusing but its probably just day 1 of dealing with it. The lack of TA's being free though was probably a large part of today. But also my own minor gains and also my own stubbornness is getting in the way of my learning. Its frustrating knowing what you want to type out but being unable to get it to run.
